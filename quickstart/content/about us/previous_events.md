This isn't our first rodeo!

We have been running Django Girls workshops for a number of years and each time, have had a sell-out event.

In 2017, we decided to start a series of monthly workshops called Women Tech Space to provide a more regular slot to provide local women with the help and support they need to continue their coding journey.

Women Tech Space ran for a few years but since late 2018, we have taken a brief hiatus as life/work/children took over for a little while!

Now we are back and running solely under the Women Tech Space name. Our upcoming workshop will still be using the Django Girls tutorial, however if you have something in particular you would like help with, we are more than happy to give a hand!

Some pics from previous events, which have been held in Farset Labs, PWC and Puppet.
